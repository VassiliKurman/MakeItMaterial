--Project Overview

In this project, XYZReader app is redesigned to follow the Material Design guidelines and translated a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app. XYZReader is a mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines. The start source code can be  downloaded here[]. This repository stores the starter code for the XYZReader project in Udacity's Android Nanodegree. The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users. The main job is to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

--Why this Project?

This project gives an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.
